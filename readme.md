##SociaDAO
SociaDAO is a blockchain-based social media app that aims to solve the privacy issues and other problems of the current centralized platforms. It is an upcoming startup that is expected to launch in 2024 in India, where social media users are growing rapidly and facing various challenges such as censorship, data breaches, fake news, and cyberbullying.

SociaDAO will allow users to create and share content on a decentralized network that runs on blockchain technology. Users will have full control over their data and identity, and will be able to monetize their content by earning tokens that can be used for various purposes within the app. Users will also be able to vote on the governance and development of the platform, ensuring that it remains transparent, democratic, and community-driven.
